Run this command to see the results using my Trigram model
 > python data.py trigram

To run the Unigram model, use this command
 > python data.py unigram


To use lambda values besides 0.9 for Trigrams and 0.1 for Unigrams, add two more arguments (first for Trigrams, second for Unigrams). They must add up to one, and both be between 0 and 1. 
EX: 
 > python data.py trigram .5 .5
